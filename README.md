# CMfM

Crack Monitoring from Motion (CMfM) integrates photogrammetric techniques with deep learning methods for automatic detection and monitoring of cracks. CMfM uses a series of images collected by moving cameras to monitor crack propagation over time. Unlike conventional techniques, CMfM does not require fixed artificial targets and overcomes the limitations of using a fixed camera of the 2D DIC. This opens up new possibilities for automatically monitoring crack propagation using images collected with mobile mapping systems in long infrastructures such as tunnels and bridges. The algorithm is entirely automatic and does not require the presence of any targets or un-deformed regions within the images. The widespread adoption of CMfM can hence lead to significant improvements in structural health monitoring and maintenance.
Our approach employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatically detecting the shape of the cracks and a skeletonization approach for delineating the center line of the defects and automatically selecting the points of interest around the cracked area. Then, we compute the change in the distance between the automatically selected points on the left and right sides of the crack for estimating the crack width propagation over time. The proposed approach is based on homography estimation and template matching techniques.
